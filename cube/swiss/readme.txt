Using cheats:
Cheats are stored in a Qoob based file format, they may be edited/updated
using the included cheats editor. You may convert action replay codes using
GCNCrypt and then add those too.
Swiss comes with a embedded cheats database but if you have an updated one,
place it as device:\cheats.qch and it will picked up and loaded instead of 
the internal cheats database.

IMPORTANT:
- 480P video mode forcing is Work in Progress - it may not work at all yet!
- Disc dumping is known to corrupt some HDD's - still work in progress!
